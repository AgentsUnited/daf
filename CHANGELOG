When a service is listed under "updates to" it will need rebuilt. To save rebuilding everything (which can take a while) you can run:

docker-compose build <names>

where <names> is the list of services to rebuild, e.g.

docker-compose build dgep utterance_generator

New updates will be listed at the top under the date the updates were committed to master. Be sure to build everything listed since your last build.
