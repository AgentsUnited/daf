DEFCon is a lightweight library for building structured dialogue frameworks. It
provides the core of the Dialogue Game Execution Platform (DGEP) but exists
as a separate module to allow for DGEP-like functionality to be embedded
into applications without needing to rely on DGEP and the Dialogue Game
Description Language (DGDL).

Note that primary development focus is on DGEP and as such documentation for
DEFcon is rather limited. For now, it primarily exists to ensure that the core
functionality of DGEP remains separate from the outset so that, in time, there
is the option and possibility of maintaining DEFCon as a project in its own
right. We therefore currently encourage you to use DGEP, either as a standalone
service or a module in itself.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in using DEFcon on its own, feel free to get
in touch.
