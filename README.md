## Dialogue and Argumentation Framework
The Dialogue and Argumentation Framework provides the core logic component for Agents United and underpins the structured dialogues that agents
can have with the user, and between themselves.

Two dialogue managent platforms are supported: the Dialogue Game Execution Platform, where the general structure of a dialogue is modelled
using a dialogue game, and WOOL, where dialogues are scripted with all possible interactions pre-specified.
