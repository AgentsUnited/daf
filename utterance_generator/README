The filstantiator (*very* working title) takes abstract move types from DGEP
and attempts to instantiate them with content.

The general process is as follows:

1) Grab a "participant model" (PM) and "coaching content" (CC) from the coaching engine.

    The PM will contain preference orderings over:

    a) The coach's current "values" - i.e. what the coach wants to achieve at this point in time
    b) The coach's choice of move type (e.g. socratic, authoritative etc.)

    The CC will contain the content that can be used to instantiate the abstract move types.
    This content will also contain a set of values that it promotes - the same
    types of value that the coach might want to achieve

2) Load in an "argumentation model" (AM). The AM contains a set of general rules
    and other principles that govern how a move and content should be selected

3) Order the move types (socratic etc.) based on the coach's move type ordering

4) Use the coach's preferences from the PM to determine a preference ordering
    over the content: loosely, this looks at the values promoted by the different
    content, then orders the content based on where those values fit in to the
    coach's values

5) Build up the argumentation model with the 3) and 4) above, along with
    representations of the moves, move types etc. as premises

6) Evaluate the argumentation model

7) Take the set of all acceptable conclusions and extract:
    1) The chosen move type(s)
    2) The content that can instantiate those move(s)
